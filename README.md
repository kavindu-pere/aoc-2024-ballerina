# Advent of Code 2024 - Ballerina

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, implemented in the Ballerina programming language.

## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides daily programming challenges from December 1st to December 25th. This repository aims to solve these challenges using Ballerina, a versatile, open-source programming language designed for cloud-native applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) (version 2201.5.0 or later)
- A code editor or IDE with Ballerina support (e.g., VS Code with the Ballerina extension)

## Structure

Each day's challenge will be in its own directory under the `solutions` folder. The directory structure is as follows:

```
aoc-2024-ballerina/
│
├── solutions/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── part1.bal
│   │   └── part2.bal
│   ├── day02/
│   │   ├── part1.bal
│   │   └── part2.bal
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md
```

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day and part, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Ballerina file. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, Part 1:

```sh
cd solutions/day01
ballerina run part1.bal
```
